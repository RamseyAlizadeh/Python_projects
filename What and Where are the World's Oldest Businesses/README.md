Project Description: <br />
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions.__
Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years.__
In this project, we'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?__
Like many business problems, the data we'll explore is contained in several different datasets.__
In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data.__
From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.__
